I'm really proud of this comic as it requires me to just think really hard.

A lot of my pieces are mostly observational - just have a funny twist to day to day life and you're sorted. Kinda easy after a while

But pieces like this test my creativity - I really need to think about how I can use the characteristics of an inanimate object and use that to come up with something interesting.
