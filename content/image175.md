Was a little annoyed by how dehumanizing it can be to apply to a VISA to certain countries. We deserve more respect.


Do check out [[image39.md|Comic-ing inanimate objects]] on why using an inanimate object like a suitcase is an interesting area of comics and different from a lot of my usual stuff.

Check #inanimate-objects for other pieces in this vein.
