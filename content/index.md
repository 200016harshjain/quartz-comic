title: Comic Graph

"A big secret is that you can bend the world to your will a surprising percentage of the time—most people don’t even try, and just accept that things are the way that they are."

I've always been really inspired by the above Sam Altman quote. A world where we have digital graphs that displays the ideas/themes behind someone's art is a world that I would really like to live in so I suppose this is just my attempt in creating a future I would want to live in.

This is also a very authentic social signal of smart, interesting and competent. Pretty good funnel for friendships, relationships and a day job :)
