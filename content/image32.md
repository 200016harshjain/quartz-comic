I'm not sure if I'm introverted or not - I do get a little uncomfortable in large groups but that's also because the conversation is embarassingly sad. All for making friends but reducing something as cool as human connection as a bro will you pls refer me is quite sad. I will anyway help you as much as possible if we are friends??
